# Wildlife Knowledge Base in Prolog

This repository contains a comprehensive Prolog knowledge base developed for a wildlife and zoo management domain. The system is built upon the `BB_KB_framework.pl` template and supports logical inference across animals, habitats, zookeepers, conservation authorities, and emergency response chains.

## Project Overview

This project models complex interactions between entities such as:
- Predators and prey
- Zookeepers and assigned animals
- Zoo infrastructure and emergency response
- Conservation authorities and policy reactions
- Media broadcasts and VIP escalations

All facts and rules are logically structured and inference-driven using custom predicates and negation, supporting multi-depth reasoning.

## Knowledge Domains

The knowledge base covers:
- **Animals**: Predators, prey, aggression levels, living conditions
- **Habitats**: Zoos, animal residency, inter-zoo cooperation
- **People**: Zookeepers, inspectors, VIPs, and their assignments
- **Governance**: Government bodies, conservation authorities, media
- **Emergency Handling**: Threat detection, relocation, funding, and reform

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Prolog
- **Framework**: `Framework.pl`
- **Features**: Dynamic inference, negation, depth-limited reasoning
